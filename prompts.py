Extract data from a static LinkedIn profile (e.g., a screenshot) to populate the provided JSON structure. Focus on the following core sections: name, title, location, About, skills, experience, education, top voices, and languages. Perform the following:

1. Identify and extract data from visible sections matching the JSON fields.
2. For sections like About, experience, or skills that appear truncated, assume a "Show More Stuart has been clicked and extract all visible content.
3. Collect all listed skills in the skills section.
4. For top voices, locate the Interests section at the end of the profile, assume the "Mostrar todos los Top Voices" button has been clicked, and extract up to 10 most relevant entries (name, title, followers) if available; if fewer than 10 are found, extract all available; if none are found, return an empty list.
5. Map extracted data to the JSON structure, ensuring completeness and accuracy for all fields: name, title, location, about, skills, experience (including job_positions with title, location, description, start_date, end_date, skills), education (school, degree, start_date, end_date), top_voices, and languages (language, level).
6. Ignore irrelevant content such as ads, UI elements, "People also viewed," or promotional sections.
7. Do not infer or generate data beyond what is visible in the profile.

To extract data from a static LinkedIn profile image efficiently, follow this structured plan:

1. Locate Core Sections: Scan the profile for sections labeled or visually structured as name, title, location, About, skills, experience, education, top voices (within Interests), and languages.
2. Field Extraction Strategy:
   - Name: Extract the prominent name at the profile’s top, typically in bold or large font.
   - Title: Identify the job title or headline below the name, often including company name.
   - Location: Find the location text, usually near the title or in a dedicated field.
   - About: Extract the summary text from the About section, including all visible content if expanded.
   - Skills: Collect all skills listed in the skills section, typically in a grid or list format.
   - Experience: Identify the experience section, extracting each job position’s title, location, description, start_date, end_date, and associated skills. Group positions by company if applicable, noting overall company tenure (start_date, end_date).
   - Education: Extract each entry in the education section, including school, degree, start_date, and end_date.
   - Top Voices: Locate the Interests section at the profile’s end, assume "Mostrar todos los Top Voices" has been clicked, and extract up to 10 most relevant entries (name, title, followers count) based on follower count or prominence; if fewer than 10, extract all; if none, return an empty list.
   - Languages: Extract each language and proficiency level from the languages section.
3. Handling Truncated Content: Assume "Show More" has been clicked for sections like About, experience, or skills, and extract all visible data.
4. Avoid Noise: Disregard UI elements, ads, sidebars, or sections like "People also viewed" or promotional content.
5. Data Mapping: Format extracted data to match the JSON structure, ensuring consistent field names and data types (e.g., dates in "YYYY-MM" format, "Present" for ongoing roles).
6. Validation: Verify that all JSON fields are populated with visible data or left empty if not available, without inferring missing information. This plan ensures token-efficient extraction, focusing solely on visible, relevant content and aligning with the JSON structure.
