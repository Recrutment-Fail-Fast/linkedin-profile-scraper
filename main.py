    This endpoint scrapes a LinkedIn profile and evaluates the prospect against specific job criteria.
    
    The process includes:
    1. Scraping the LinkedIn profile data
    2. Evaluating the prospect against job requirements
    3. Returning success/failure with descriptive message
    
    If the prospect doesn't meet the main job requirements, the system will attempt to find 
    alternative positions that might be a better fit.
